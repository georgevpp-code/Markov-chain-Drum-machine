# Markov-chain-Drum-machine
This repo consists of a markov chain based Drum machine based in PureData Vanilla.
A Markov chain is a state based probability mechanism in which the the probability of a future state being reached is 
dependent on the current state of the machine. 

This 8 step drum machine uses natively synthesized kicks, hihats and snares that can be toggled in any manner 
you like along with tempo control and toggles between manual and markov modes.
